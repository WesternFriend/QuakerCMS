# Initial design considerations
These notes were compiled in an online hangout on 2019-11-30. Present were @jfinmaniv and @brylie.

## Types of content Quakers share:
- Pamphlets (e.g. Pendle Hill)
- Newsletters
- Epistles
- Minutes
- Announcements
- Events

## Roles
- Technical coordinator - manages site infrastructure if using self-hosted, or custom domain
- Administrator - configures initial site settings
- Content manager(s) - log in and add/update content
- Meeting attenders - might use internal content such as membership directory

## Desirable features for QuakerCMS
- Simple content management
- Multi-site architecture (hosting for multiple meetings in a single instance)
- Federated (content from one instance can be shared to other instances)
- Integrated with Nextcloud (for file sharing, online meetings, polls, etc.)
- Content syndication with standard formats (RSS, Atom)
- Meeting location displayed on a map (open source, without Google dependency)
- No dependency on proprietery services or software
- Mobile friendly (responsive UI)
- Meeting directories

## Initial tasks
- set up code repository
- create project scaffold
- research Quaker websites
- look for common features/content types

## Questions
- Who are our prospective users?
- Do we have any users now?
- Who might be our first user?
- Who might give us feedback?
