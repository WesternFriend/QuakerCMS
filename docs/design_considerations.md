# Initial design considerations
These notes were compiled in an online hangout on 2019-11-30. Present were @jfinmaniv and @brylie.

## Types of content Quakers share:
Pamphlets (e.g. Pendle Hill)
Newsletters
Epistles
Minutes
Announcements
Events

## Roles
Technical coordinator - manages site infrastructure if using self-hosted, or custom domain
Administrator - configures initial site settings
Content manager(s) - log in and add/update content
Meeting attenders - might use internal content such as membership directory

## Desirable features for QuakerCMS
simple content management
multi-site architecture (hosting for multiple meetings in a single instance)
federated (content from one instance can be shared to other instances)
Integrated with Nextcloud (for file sharing, online meetings, polls, etc.)
Content syndication with standard formats (RSS, Atom)
Meeting location displayed on a map (open source, without Google dependency)
No dependency on proprietery services or software
Mobile friendly (responsive UI)
Meeting directories

## Initial tasks
set up code repository
create project scaffold
research Quaker websites
look for common features/content types

## Questions
Who are our prospective users?
Do we have any users now?
Who might be our first user?
Who might give us feedback?
