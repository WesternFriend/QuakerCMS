## Purpose

QuakerCMS provides a standardized platform for Quaker communities to publish and discover important content, fostering connection and continuity within the broader Quaker movement. The system recognizes the unique content types and communication patterns that are central to Quaker spiritual life and community organization.

## Vision

We envision a federated network of Quaker websites that can share content with one another, making it easier for meetings and worship groups to:

- Preserve and share their spiritual writings and corporate decisions
- Discover content from other Quaker communities
- Maintain their historical records in a structured, accessible format
- Connect with the broader Quaker movement through shared resources
