# Contributing to QuakerCMS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to QuakerCMS! This guide will help you set up your development environment and get started.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Git

## Development Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WesternFriend/QuakerCMS.git
cd QuakerCMS
```

### 2. Install uv (if not already installed)

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### Windows
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Or install via pip:
```bash
pip install uv
```

### 3. Create and Sync Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment and install all dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command will:
- Create a virtual environment in `.venv/`
- Install all project dependencies
- Install development dependencies (like `ruff` for linting) automatically

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### Windows (Command Prompt)
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### 5. Navigate to the Django Project Directory

```bash
cd src
```

### 6. Run Database Migrations

Set up the database by running the initial migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create a Superuser Account

Create an admin account to access the Wagtail admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create your admin account with username, email, and password.

### 8. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 9. Access the Site

Once the server is running, you can access:

- **Main site**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- **Wagtail admin**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Log in to the admin interface using the superuser credentials you created in step 7.

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality

This project uses `ruff` for code linting and formatting. Before submitting changes:

```bash
# Run linting
uv run ruff check .

# Run formatting
uv run ruff format .
```

### Adding Dependencies

To add new dependencies:

```bash
# Add a runtime dependency
uv add package-name

# Add a development dependency
uv add --dev package-name
```

### Running Tests

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Updating Dependencies

To update all dependencies to their latest compatible versions:

```bash
uv sync --upgrade
```
