# Feature Specification: Multi-lingual Navigation Menu System

**Feature Branch**: `002-nav-menu-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We need to allow users to define a navigation menu, similar to the WordPress menu system. They will select pages that will become menu links, using the page title or an optional alias. The menu items may be nested, but top-level items in the nested menu should only cause the menu to open. So, we need our menu system to support adding pages or submenus. A further complication but necessary requirement will be multi-lingual menu support. One option would be that each menu page would be selected in the default locale. Then, the locale-specific menus would be auto-generated by finding the equivalent item that links to the selected page. However, this may lead to complications in partially translated sites, where there aren't matching pages in the user locale. In that case, it might make sense to fall back to the default page, since it is guaranteed to exist."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-26

- Q: For mobile devices (mobile/tablet breakpoints: `< lg` / < 1024px), what UX pattern should the hamburger menu use when opened? → A: DaisyUI drawer component that slides in from left side
- Q: How should dropdown menus open on desktop devices? → A: Hover on desktop breakpoint (`lg+` / ≥1024px), click/tap on all devices
- Q: How should dropdown menus behave inside the mobile hamburger drawer? → A: Accordion-style expansion within drawer (submenus expand in-place below parent item)
- Q: When a page linked in a menu is deleted, how should the system handle that menu item? → A: Automatically remove from menu immediately when page is deleted (or prevent deletion to preserve referential integrity)
- Q: When the navigation menu has no menu items configured, how should it render on the front-end? → A: Hide `<nav>` element entirely (do not render navigation section at all)

### Session 2025-11-03

- Q: Should the navigation menu implement caching to reduce database load? → A: Yes - use database cache (1-hour TTL, invalidate on menu save)
- Q: Should the navigation menu implement error logging and monitoring? → A: Yes - Django logging (ERROR level to console + file)
- Q: Should the system enforce a maximum total number of menu items? → A: Soft limit (100 items total) - show admin warning when approaching limit, allow override for edge cases

## Design Philosophy

This feature prioritizes **simplicity over flexibility** to serve Quaker meetings and worship groups who need to focus on content rather than technical configuration. Unlike WordPress's multi-menu system, QuakerCMS provides a single, site-wide navigation menu that covers the primary use case without requiring users to understand concepts like "menu locations" or "menu assignment." This intentional constraint reduces cognitive load and administrative overhead while still delivering full multi-lingual support and nested menu capabilities.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Basic Navigation Menu (Priority: P1)

As a site administrator, I need to create a simple navigation menu with top-level pages so that visitors can navigate the site's main sections.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the navigation system. Without the ability to create a basic menu with page links, no other menu functionality is possible. This delivers immediate value by enabling basic site navigation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a menu with 3-5 top-level page links in the admin interface, saving it, and verifying the menu displays on the front-end with correct links and labels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged into the admin interface, **When** I navigate to Settings → Navigation Menu, **Then** I see the navigation menu editor
2. **Given** I am creating a new menu, **When** I add a page to the menu without providing a custom title, **Then** the page's own title appears as the menu item label
3. **Given** I am adding a page to the menu, **When** I provide a custom title, **Then** I can optionally add translations for that title in enabled locales
4. **Given** I have added a custom title without translations, **When** visitors view the menu in any locale, **Then** the custom title displays as-is (same text for all locales)
5. **Given** I have added a custom title with translations for some locales, **When** a visitor views the menu in a locale with a translation, **Then** the translated title displays
6. **Given** I have added a custom title with translations, **When** a visitor views the menu in a locale without a translation, **Then** the default custom title displays
7. **Given** I have created a menu with multiple items, **When** I save the menu, **Then** the menu appears on the front-end in the order I specified
8. **Given** a visitor clicks a menu item, **When** the page loads, **Then** they navigate to the correct page

---

### User Story 2 - Organize Menu with Dropdowns (Priority: P2)

As a site administrator, I need to create dropdown menus to group related pages so that I can organize content logically and reduce visual clutter.

**Why this priority**: Dropdown menus are essential for sites with many pages, but they build upon the basic menu functionality. This can be developed after the core menu system works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a menu with at least one dropdown containing 3+ child items, verifying the submenu opens on hover/click, and confirming child items navigate correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am editing a menu, **When** I add a dropdown menu item, **Then** I can add page links and external links within that dropdown
2. **Given** I am creating a dropdown menu, **When** I set the dropdown title, **Then** I can provide translations for that title in all enabled locales
3. **Given** I have created a menu with dropdowns, **When** I save the menu, **Then** the structure is preserved on the front-end
4. **Given** a visitor views a menu with dropdown items, **When** they hover over or click a dropdown menu item, **Then** the submenu expands to show child items
5. **Given** a visitor views a dropdown menu in a specific locale, **When** the dropdown has a title translation for that locale, **Then** the translated title displays
6. **Given** a dropdown menu item exists, **When** a visitor clicks the dropdown menu title itself, **Then** it only opens the submenu without navigating (the dropdown title is not clickable as a link)
7. **Given** I want to reorder menu items, **When** I use the up/down arrow controls in the admin interface, **Then** the menu items move to the new position
8. **Given** I have reordered menu items, **When** I save the menu, **Then** the new order is preserved on the front-end
9. **Given** a dropdown menu is positioned near the right edge of the screen, **When** a visitor opens it, **Then** the submenu opens to the left to prevent horizontal overflow
10. **Given** a dropdown menu is positioned near the left edge of the screen, **When** a visitor opens it, **Then** the submenu opens to the right to remain visible
11. **Given** a dropdown menu has sufficient space in all directions, **When** a visitor opens it, **Then** the submenu opens downward by default

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-lingual Menu Auto-generation (Priority: P3)

As a site administrator, I need menus to automatically adapt to the visitor's language while falling back gracefully when translations are missing, so that visitors have consistent navigation regardless of their language preference.

**Why this priority**: Multi-lingual support is important for international sites, but the core menu system must work first. This is an enhancement that builds on P1 and P2 functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a menu in the default locale with 5 pages (3 fully translated, 2 untranslated), switching to a non-default locale, and verifying that translated pages show locale-specific versions while untranslated pages link to default locale versions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I create a menu in the default locale (e.g., English), **When** I select pages for menu items, **Then** the system records these as the canonical menu structure
2. **Given** I create a menu item with a custom label, **When** I provide translations for that label, **Then** the system stores the label translations for each enabled locale
3. **Given** a menu exists in the default locale, **When** a visitor views the site in a different locale (e.g., Spanish), **Then** the menu structure automatically displays with locale-appropriate page links and labels
4. **Given** a menu item has a custom label translation in the visitor's locale, **When** the visitor views the menu, **Then** the custom label translation displays
5. **Given** a menu item has no custom label translation in the visitor's locale, **When** the visitor views the menu, **Then** the system uses the translated page title (or falls back to default locale page title if no page translation exists)
6. **Given** a menu item links to a page with a translation in the visitor's locale, **When** the visitor views the menu, **Then** the menu item links to the translated page
7. **Given** a menu item links to a page without a translation in the visitor's locale, **When** the visitor views the menu, **Then** the menu item links to the default locale version of the page
8. **Given** a partially translated site, **When** a visitor navigates using the menu, **Then** they experience seamless navigation even when some pages fall back to the default language
9. **Given** I update a page's translation, **When** the menu regenerates for that locale, **Then** the menu item automatically updates to link to the new translation

### User Story 4 - Accessible Navigation for All Users (Priority: P1)

As a visitor using assistive technology (screen reader, keyboard-only, or mobile device), I need the navigation menu to be fully accessible so that I can navigate the site independently regardless of my abilities or device.

**Why this priority**: Accessibility is a legal requirement (ADA, Section 508) and ethical obligation, not a nice-to-have feature. This must be built into the foundation from day one, not retrofitted later. Affects 15-20% of users (disabilities, mobile users, keyboard-only users).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by:

1. Using NVDA/JAWS screen reader to navigate menu and verify proper announcements
2. Using only keyboard (no mouse) to open dropdowns and activate all links
3. Testing with JavaScript disabled to verify `<details>`/`<summary>` fallback
4. Running automated accessibility scan (axe DevTools) to verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
5. Testing on mobile device to verify touch target sizes and hamburger menu
6. Testing in dark/light themes to verify proper contrast ratios

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a keyboard-only user, **When** I press Tab key, **Then** I can navigate through all menu items with visible focus indicators
2. **Given** I am on a dropdown menu item, **When** I press Enter or Space, **Then** the dropdown opens and focus moves to first child item
3. **Given** I have a dropdown open, **When** I press Escape, **Then** the dropdown closes and focus returns to the parent trigger
4. **Given** I am using a screen reader, **When** I encounter a dropdown menu, **Then** I hear "menu item, has submenu" or similar announcement
5. **Given** I am using a screen reader, **When** I navigate to a menu item, **Then** I hear the item's position (e.g., "item 2 of 5") and current state
6. **Given** I am on the current page, **When** I navigate the menu, **Then** the corresponding menu item is announced as "current page"
7. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I tap the hamburger menu button, **Then** the button has sufficient touch target size (44x44 pixels minimum) and the menu opens
8. **Given** I have JavaScript disabled, **When** I click a dropdown menu, **Then** the dropdown still expands using native `<details>` element behavior
9. **Given** I am using the site in dark mode, **When** the menu renders, **Then** all text and interactive elements have sufficient contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
10. **Given** I am at the top of the page, **When** I press Tab, **Then** the first focusable element is a "Skip to main content" link
11. **Given** I use the skip link, **When** I activate it, **Then** focus moves to the main content area, bypassing the navigation menu
12. **Given** I am a color-blind user, **When** I hover over menu items, **Then** I can distinguish hover states through multiple visual indicators (not just color)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a page linked in a menu is deleted? (Menu item is automatically removed; optionally prevent page deletion and show warning if page is referenced in menu)
- What happens when a menu has no items? (Navigation section does not render - `<nav>` element is completely omitted from DOM)
- How are menu items ordered when new items are added? (Default to bottom of current level, allow reordering via up/down arrows)
- What happens when a locale is deleted? (Menu items automatically fall back to default locale for that language)
- How does the system handle pages that exist in some locales but not the default locale? (This violates the assumed pattern - default locale should have all pages, only allow linking pages that exist in default locale)
- What happens when an external URL becomes invalid? (System cannot validate external URLs, administrator responsible for maintaining valid links)
- How are anchor links validated? (Anchors are not validated, administrator responsible for ensuring target anchors exist on the page)
- What happens when a custom title translation is missing for a locale? (Fall back to the default custom title text)
- What happens when no custom title is provided? (Use the page's own translated title, falling back to default locale title if page not translated)
- How are custom title translations stored? (As optional locale-text pairs within each menu item - only needed when overriding page titles)
- What about additional menus (footer, sidebar)? (Out of scope for this feature - this implements the primary navigation menu only; additional menus can be added as separate settings in future features)
- What if a dropdown menu would extend beyond the viewport? (Frontend implements edge detection: menus near right edge open left, menus near left edge open right, default opens down)
- How does edge detection work on mobile devices? (Same logic applies but with smaller viewport - menus adapt to available space using responsive positioning)
- What happens when the viewport is resized while a menu is open? (Menu position should recalculate and adjust if needed, or close and require reopening)
- How does keyboard navigation work with nested dropdowns? (Tab moves between top-level items, Enter/Space opens dropdowns, Arrow keys navigate within dropdowns, Escape closes dropdowns)
- What happens if JavaScript is disabled? (Navigation remains functional using `<details>`/`<summary>` elements for progressive enhancement)
- How does dark mode affect menu styling? (Menu uses DaisyUI theme-aware classes like `bg-base-100` that automatically adapt to theme)
- How is the current page indicated in the menu? (Active menu item receives `aria-current="page"` attribute and visual styling via CSS)
- What happens on mobile/tablet breakpoints? (Navigation collapses to hamburger menu at mobile/tablet breakpoints `< lg` / < 1024px using DaisyUI responsive classes)
- How are touch targets sized for mobile accessibility? (All interactive elements have minimum 44x44 pixel touch targets per WCAG guidelines)
- How do screen readers announce dropdown menus? (Dropdown triggers use `aria-haspopup="true"` and submenus have `aria-labelledby` for proper context)
- What if a color-blind user can't distinguish hover states? (Hover/focus states use multiple visual indicators: underline, background color, and border changes - not color alone)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Responsive Breakpoints

The navigation menu system uses standard Tailwind CSS / DaisyUI breakpoints for responsive behavior:

| Breakpoint | Name           | Screen Width   | Typical Devices                        | Navigation Behavior                       |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `sm`       | Mobile (Small) | < 640px        | Phones (portrait)                      | Hamburger menu (drawer)                   |
| `md`       | Tablet         | 640px - 1023px | Phones (landscape), small tablets      | Hamburger menu (drawer)                   |
| `lg`       | Laptop/Desktop | ≥ 1024px       | Tablets (landscape), laptops, desktops | Full horizontal menu with hover dropdowns |
| `xl`       | Wide Desktop   | ≥ 1280px       | Large desktops                         | Full horizontal menu with hover dropdowns |
| `2xl`      | Ultra-wide     | ≥ 1536px       | Ultra-wide monitors                    | Full horizontal menu with hover dropdowns |

**Breakpoint Usage**:

- **Mobile/Tablet (`< lg`)**: Hamburger menu with drawer component, click/tap-only dropdowns
- **Desktop (`≥ lg`)**: Full horizontal navigation with hover-enabled dropdowns (also click/tap for accessibility)

### Key Entities

- **NavigationMenuSetting**: A site-wide setting that stores the navigation menu structure using a StreamField. Registered as a Wagtail BaseSiteSetting accessible via Settings in the admin interface.
- **Menu Item**: Can be one of three types (StreamField blocks):
  - **Internal Page Link**: References a Wagtail page, optional custom title (with optional translations), optional anchor
  - **External URL Link**: Contains a URL, title (with optional translations), optional anchor
  - **Dropdown Menu**: Contains a title (with optional translations) and a list of child items (internal page links or external URL links ONLY - no nested dropdowns allowed)
- **Custom Title Translation**: Optional locale-text pairs for menu items. When provided, allows the menu item to display different text than the page title. When not provided, the page's own translated title is used.
- **Page**: Existing Wagtail page entity. Menu items can link to pages. Pages may have translations in multiple locales.
- **Locale**: Language/region configuration. Determines which page translations and custom title translations to use when rendering menus.

### Frontend Template Structure

- **navigation.html**: Complete navigation component template that renders the entire menu structure including mobile drawer, desktop menubar, and dropdown menus with ARIA semantics, responsive layout, DaisyUI components, and theme support. Included in `base.html` for site-wide availability.
- **Skip Link**: Visually hidden anchor link positioned as first focusable element in `base.html`, allowing keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump to main content (WCAG 2.1 requirement).
- **Theme Classes**: DaisyUI theme-aware utility classes (e.g., `bg-base-100`, `text-base-content`) that automatically adapt to active theme (light/dark) without hardcoded colors.
