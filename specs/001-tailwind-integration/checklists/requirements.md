# Specification Quality Checklist: Tailwind CSS Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: PASS
   - Specification focuses on user outcomes (content managers publishing styled content, visitors viewing in dark mode)
   - No specific framework implementation details in requirements
   - Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders

2. **Requirement Completeness**: PASS
   - All 12 functional requirements are clear and testable
   - Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "under 50KB gzipped", "within 2 seconds", "WCAG AA contrast")
   - All three user stories have complete acceptance scenarios
   - Edge cases identified for HTML conflicts, layout breaks, and admin interface interaction
   - Assumptions section clearly documents dependencies (Node.js, modern browsers, etc.)

3. **Feature Readiness**: PASS
   - Each functional requirement can be verified independently
   - User stories are prioritized (P1: Typography, P2: Components, P3: Dark mode)
   - Each story can be tested independently and delivers standalone value
   - Success criteria are outcome-focused, not implementation-focused

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- All quality checks passed on first validation iteration
- No clarifications needed - all requirements have reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section
